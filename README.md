# Design thinking : During our design thinking assignment, my group and I collaborated effectively to create a compelling poster and deliver a captivating presentation. We embraced diverse perspectives, fostered creativity, and learned the value of empathy in the design process. It was a valuable experience that enhanced our problem-solving skills.
